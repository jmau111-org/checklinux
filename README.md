# checklinux

A simple Bash script to check Debian-based Linux machines inspired by [golinux](https://github.com/jmau111/golinux)

## Disclaimer

It's essentially a personal wrapper for useful scripts that check Linux installations.

## How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/jmau111/checklinux
sudo -s
cd checklinux
bash checklinux
```

## Opt out

You can either select "1" to proceed or "2" to skip a specific analysis.

## Warnings

Be careful. The script doesn't update your installation.

**I strongly encourage you to update && upgrade** to prevent bad errors and apply security patches.
